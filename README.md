# Code Keep
 Keep your "Inspect Element" Changes!

### Installation
The extension isn't available yet but I plan to upload it to Firefox as soon as possible!
You can try it by installing it as a "temporary" or "unpacked" extension.

**Chrome**

 Web Scrobbler made a nice tutorial on how to load unpacked extension on Chrome:
 [Install an unpacked extension](https://github.com/web-scrobbler/web-scrobbler/wiki/Install-an-unpacked-extension)

**Firefox**

Here is the official documentation to temprary install an extension:

### Usage
- Once installed, go to a webpage, modify it as you wish using inspect elements, click on the extension icon and click "Save the page!".

The page should normally keep your changes even if you reload the it!

- To remove a webpage from the saved webpages and refresh it (keep up-to-date information) (especially if it is a dynamic website), visit the webpage, click on the extension icon and hit 'Delete the saved page!'

The webpage should reload with all the latest information.

- To clear the saved pages (delete changes made on every site), click on the extension icon, click on 'List of saved pages'.

- A new window should appear with all your modified/saved sites and you should be able to click on 'Clear everything' to clear every saved pages.




### Known issues

##### YouTube
YouTube doesn't seem to work well/seems to break when saved (there is no search bar for example).

> I think that this issue comes with how YouTube is made: a dynamic website which reloads its content multiple times when you're browsing it.
